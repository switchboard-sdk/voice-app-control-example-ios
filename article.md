# Building Voice-Controlled iOS Apps with On-Device AI: A Complete Guide

*Transform your iOS app into a voice-controlled experience using real-time speech recognition and intelligent command processing*

## The Voice Control Revolution in Mobile Apps

Picture this: You're using your favorite movie streaming app, but instead of tapping through endless menus, you simply say "next movie" or "like this one" and the app responds instantly. No internet connection required, no privacy concerns about your voice data being sent to cloud servers, and no frustrating delays waiting for remote processing.

This isn't science fiction—it's the present reality of on-device voice control, and it's transforming how users interact with mobile applications. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through building a fully voice-controlled iOS app using SwitchboardSDK, complete with real-time speech recognition, intelligent command processing, and seamless user experience.

## Why On-Device Voice Control Matters

### The Privacy Advantage
When voice processing happens entirely on the user's device, sensitive audio data never leaves their phone. This isn't just a nice-to-have feature—it's becoming a fundamental requirement as privacy regulations tighten and users become more conscious of their data security.

### Performance That Delivers
Cloud-based voice recognition introduces latency that can make interactions feel sluggish. On-device processing eliminates network delays, providing the instant responsiveness users expect from modern applications.

### Reliability You Can Count On
Your app works perfectly whether users are on a mountain with no cell service or in a subway tunnel with spotty Wi-Fi. On-device voice control ensures consistent functionality regardless of connectivity.

## What We're Building: A Voice-Controlled Movie Browser

Our example application demonstrates sophisticated voice control capabilities:

- **Natural Navigation**: Users can say "next", "previous", "forward", or "back" to browse through content
- **Intelligent Actions**: Commands like "like this", "expand details", or "dislike" trigger specific UI responses
- **Smart Content Jumping**: Users can speak movie titles directly to jump to specific content
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Visual indicators show recognized commands as they're processed

The app showcases how voice control can make complex navigation feel effortless and intuitive.

## Architecture: The Foundation of Great Voice Control

### The Three-Layer Architecture

Our voice-controlled app uses a sophisticated three-layer architecture that separates concerns while maintaining performance:

**1. SwiftUI Interface Layer**
The modern iOS interface provides reactive updates and smooth animations. Voice commands trigger immediate visual feedback, creating a responsive user experience.

**2. Objective-C Bridge Layer**
This crucial layer connects the Swift UI with the C++ processing engine, handling protocol communications and thread management seamlessly.

**3. C++ Voice Processing Engine**
The core engine manages audio processing, speech recognition, and command matching using SwitchboardSDK's optimized algorithms.

### Audio Processing Pipeline

The magic happens through a carefully orchestrated audio processing pipeline:

```
Microphone → Voice Activity Detection → Speech Recognition → Command Processing → UI Action
```

Each stage is optimized for real-time performance while maintaining accuracy.

## Prerequisites and Setup

Before diving into the implementation, ensure you have:

- **Xcode 12.0 or later** - For iOS development
- **iOS 13.0 or later** - Target deployment version
- **SwitchboardSDK credentials** - App ID and App Secret from [switchboard.audio](https://switchboard.audio)

### Quick Start Setup

Getting started is straightforward:

1. **Download the SwitchboardSDK frameworks:**
   ```bash
   bash scripts/setup.sh
   ```

2. **Open the project in Xcode:**
   ```bash
   open AppControlExample.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Configure your credentials in `AppControlExampleApp.swift`:**

   ```

4. **Build and run** - Select your device and press Run

## The Voice Command System

### Complete Command Reference

Our app recognizes 21 different voice commands across three categories:

**Navigation Commands:**
- **Next**: "next", "forward", "skip", "down"
- **Previous**: "back", "last", "previous", "up"

**Action Commands:**
- **Like**: "like", "favourite", "heart"
- **Dislike**: "dislike", "dont like", "do not like"
- **Expand**: "expand", "details", "open"

**Smart Navigation:**
- **Movie Titles**: "Dune", "Jaws", "Matrix", "Tron", "Soul", "Frozen", "Avatar", "Inception", "Interstellar"

### How Commands Are Processed

The system uses sophisticated text processing to ensure accurate command recognition:

1. **Audio Capture**: Continuous microphone monitoring at 16kHz
2. **Voice Activity Detection**: Silero VAD identifies speech segments
3. **Speech Recognition**: Whisper STT converts speech to text
4. **Text Cleaning**: Removes punctuation and normalizes formatting
5. **Command Matching**: Longest-match algorithm finds the best keyword
6. **UI Updates**: Corresponding actions execute in the SwiftUI interface

## Deep Dive: The Audio Processing Pipeline

### AudioGraph.json Configuration

The heart of our voice control system is the `AudioGraph.json` configuration file, which defines the entire audio processing pipeline:

```json
{
  "type": "RealTimeGraphRenderer",
  "config": {
    "microphoneEnabled": true,
    "graph": {
      "config": {
        "sampleRate": 16000,
        "bufferSize": 512
      },
      "nodes": [
        {
          "id": "multiChannelToMonoNode",
          "type": "MultiChannelToMono"
        },
        {
          "id": "vadNode",
          "type": "SileroVAD.SileroVAD",
          "config": {
            "frameSize": 512,
            "threshold": 0.5,
            "minSilenceDurationMs": 40
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "sttNode",
          "type": "Whisper.WhisperSTT",
          "config": {
            "initializeModel": true,
            "useGPU": true
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### SDK Integration

The app initializes three crucial SwitchboardSDK extensions:

```swift
@main
struct AppControlExampleApp: App {
    init() {
        SBSwitchboardSDK.initialize(withAppID: "YOUR_APP_ID", appSecret: "YOUR_APP_SECRET")
        SBWhisperExtension.initialize(withConfig: [:])
        SBSileroVADExtension.initialize(withConfig: [:])
    }
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            AppControlView()
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation: The C++ Engine

### Voice Command Processing Engine

The core processing happens in C++, providing optimal performance for real-time voice recognition:

```cpp
enum TriggerType {
   NEXT, BACK, LIKE, DISLIKE, EXPAND, RUNTIME_TRIGGERS, UNKNOWN
};

static std::map<TriggerType, std::vector<std::string>> triggerKeywords = {
    {TriggerType::NEXT, {"next", "forward", "skip", "down"}},
    {TriggerType::BACK, {"back", "last", "previous", "up"}},
    {TriggerType::LIKE, {"like", "favourite", "heart"}},
    {TriggerType::DISLIKE, {"dislike", "dont like", "do not like"}},
    {TriggerType::EXPAND, {"expand", "details", "open"}},
    {TriggerType::RUNTIME_TRIGGERS, {/* populated at runtime */}}
};
```

### Intelligent Text Processing

The system includes sophisticated text processing for accurate command recognition:

```cpp
static std::string clean(const std::string& phrase) {
    std::regex pattern(R"(\[[^\]]*\]|\([^\)]*\)|\*[^*]*\*)");
    std::string input = std::regex_replace(phrase, pattern, "");
    input = trim(input);
    std::transform(input.begin(), input.end(), input.begin(), ::tolower);
    input.erase(std::remove_if(input.begin(), input.end(), ::ispunct), input.end());
    return input;
}
```

### Event Handling and Real-Time Processing

The engine listens for transcription events and processes them in real-time:

```cpp
Switchboard::addEventListener("sttNode", "transcription", [weakSelf](const std::any& data) {
    const auto text = Config::convert<std::string>(data);
    std::string cleaned = clean(text);
    
    TriggerType triggerType;
    std::string detectedKeyword;
    
    if (detectTrigger(cleaned, triggerType, detectedKeyword)) {
        NSString* keyword = [NSString stringWithUTF8String:detectedKeyword.c_str()];
        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
            [strongSelf.delegate triggerDetected:(NSInteger)triggerType withKeyword:keyword];
        });
    }
});
```

## SwiftUI Integration: Reactive Voice Control

### The Control Delegate

The SwiftUI interface responds to voice commands through a reactive delegate system:

```swift
class AppControlDelegate: NSObject, ControlDelegate, ObservableObject {
    @Published var detectedKeyword = ""
    weak var verticalListViewModel: ListViewModel?
    
    func triggerDetected(_ triggerType: Int, withKeyword keyword: String) {
        guard let mode = TriggerType(rawValue: triggerType) else { return }
        
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            self.detectedKeyword = keyword
            
            switch mode {
            case .next:
                self.verticalListViewModel?.goNext()
            case .back:
                self.verticalListViewModel?.goBack()
            case .like:
                self.verticalListViewModel?.toggleLike()
            case .dislike:
                self.verticalListViewModel?.toggleDislike()
            case .expand:
                self.verticalListViewModel?.toggleExpand()
            case .runtimeTriggers:
                if let movieIndex = self.verticalListViewModel?.items.firstIndex(where: {
                    $0.title.lowercased() == keyword
                }) {
                    self.verticalListViewModel?.selectItem(at: movieIndex)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Visual Feedback System

The interface provides immediate visual feedback for recognized commands:

```swift
struct AppControlView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Voice Control Demo")
                .font(.title)
            
            Text(delegate.detectedKeyword)
                .fontWeight(.semibold)
                .font(.callout)
                .frame(minHeight: 20)
            
            ListView(viewModel: verticalListViewModel)
        }
    }
}
```

## Advanced Features: Smart Command Processing

### Runtime Trigger System

One of the most impressive features is the runtime trigger system, which allows users to speak movie titles directly:

```swift
let movieTitles = DataSource.shared.movieData.map { $0.title }
example?.setRuntimeTriggers(movieTitles)
```

This dynamic system means users can say "Avatar" or "Inception" and jump directly to those movies, demonstrating how voice control can make navigation feel almost telepathic.

### Longest-Match Algorithm

The system uses a sophisticated longest-match algorithm to handle overlapping keywords:

```cpp
bool detectTrigger(const std::string& phrase, TriggerType& outMode, std::string& outKeyword) {
    size_t bestLength = 0;
    TriggerType bestTriggerType = TriggerType::UNKNOWN;
    std::string bestKeyword;
    
    for (const auto& [triggerType, keywords] : triggerKeywords) {
        std::string match = findLongestMatch(phrase, keywords);
        if (!match.empty() && match.length() > bestLength) {
            bestTriggerType = triggerType;
            bestLength = match.length();
            bestKeyword = match;
        }
    }
    
    return bestLength > 0;
}
```

This ensures that more specific commands take precedence over general ones, providing intuitive behavior.

## Performance Optimization: Voice Activity Detection

### Silero VAD Configuration

The Silero Voice Activity Detection (VAD) system is carefully tuned for optimal performance:

```json
{
  "id": "vadNode",
  "type": "SileroVAD.SileroVAD",
  "config": {
    "frameSize": 512,
    "threshold": 0.5,
    "minSilenceDurationMs": 40
  }
}
```

These settings balance sensitivity with accuracy, ensuring the system responds quickly to speech while avoiding false triggers.

### Whisper STT Optimization

The Whisper Speech-to-Text engine is configured for maximum performance:

```json
{
  "id": "sttNode",
  "type": "Whisper.WhisperSTT",
  "config": {
    "initializeModel": true,
    "useGPU": true
  }
}
```

GPU acceleration significantly improves transcription speed, making real-time voice control feel instantaneous.

## Customization: Extending the Voice Control System

### Adding New Commands

Expanding the voice control system is straightforward:

1. **Add new trigger types:**
   ```cpp
   enum TriggerType {
       NEXT, BACK, LIKE, DISLIKE, EXPAND,
       CUSTOM_ACTION,  // New custom action
       RUNTIME_TRIGGERS, UNKNOWN
   };
   ```

2. **Define corresponding keywords:**
   ```cpp
   static std::map<TriggerType, std::vector<std::string>> triggerKeywords = {
       {TriggerType::CUSTOM_ACTION, {"custom", "special", "action"}},
       // ... existing keywords
   };
   ```

3. **Handle the new trigger in the delegate:**
   ```swift
   case .customAction:
       self.verticalListViewModel?.performCustomAction()
   ```

### Audio Processing Tuning

Fine-tune the audio processing pipeline by modifying `AudioGraph.json`:

- **Adjust VAD sensitivity** by changing the threshold value
- **Modify buffer sizes** for different latency/accuracy tradeoffs
- **Update sample rates** based on your specific requirements
